# Allied Outposts Only Require Defensive Alliances
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. By default, every race except for High Elves requires a full military alliance in order to be able to construct the Tier 2 and Tier 3 allied outpost buildings. But military alliances with the AI tend to be more of a liability than a benefit given how prone they are to waging unnecessary wars. This mod changes the requirement for all tiers of outposts to only require a defensive alliance for all races.
